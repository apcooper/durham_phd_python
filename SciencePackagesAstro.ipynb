For this tutorial we won't worry about this. The basic idea is that most astronomical images (that come from professional observatories) carry around WCS information in their FITS headers that can be used to project their CCD pixels properly onto your screen with accurate coordinate axes (accounting both for where the telescope is pointing and for the optical distortion between the sky and the CCD plane). \n",

For example, in the simplest common case, this would just do a tangent-plane projection of our spherical coordinate onto the plane of the image.\n",

    "The [`healpy` package](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows python to interact with [NASA's `HEALPIX` software](http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/). HEALPIX is a way of working with a clever equal-area pixelisation of the sphere, which is handy for anything involving statistics (or plots...) of distributions of points on the sky. It was invented mainly for work with CMB maps, but it is more widely useful for anything that's basically a histogram in spherical coordinates. Read the HEALPIX page for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, `HEALPIX` needs to be installed to use `healpy`. `pip install healpy` claims will install a copy of `HEALPIX` for you (see the installation instructions at the `healpy` link above). I have had mixed results with this in the past. If you're installing Healpy on your own machine, I recommend using `conda`; see the section 'Notes on Conda Channels' at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's installed, you can look at the tutorial on the `healpy` page (link above). The following example shows a common use case, which is just to use `HEALPIX` as a way to make a histogram of points on the sky, exploiting the fact that each of the `HEALPIX` pixels has the same area. To do this, we first have to assign points to HEALPIX pixels (using `ang2pix`), then make a histogram of the pixel numbers (using `numpy`) and finally plot that histogram as a `HEALPIX` map.\n",

The same was true for the `astroquery` package, but in that case we jumped straight to the solution (use the option `-c astropy` to select the `astropy` channel). What if we know there's a package called `healpy` somewhere, but we don't know what `conda` channel it's in?\n",
