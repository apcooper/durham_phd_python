Fortunately one of the great things about Python is that it lets you solve problems in the way you find least confusing. Sometimes this will involve classes, but only if that approach suits the problem and you. Python doesn't force you to understand the mechanics or the philosophy of defining your own classes to write sophisticated programs. "
