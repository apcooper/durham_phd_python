# Postgraduate Python Tutorial 2017/18

# Instructions

The tutorial is made up of a number of Jupyter notebooks to work through at
your own pace. The two afternoon classes are an opportunity to get started with
this and ask questions. Self-study is essential. If you're completely new to
Python the classes probably won't be enough time to get through all the
material.

The notebooks themselves and some supporting files are all in a
GitHub repository (currently https://github.com/apcooper/durham_phd_python).

[The wiki page for that
repository](https://github.com/apcooper/durham_phd_python/wiki) has some
background information (some of which will be given as slides in the classes)
and a description of the notebooks.

In the classes we'll use a local **JupyterHub Server** run by Daniel Maitre.

`https://dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/pyintro/notebooks/user/[YOUR CIS USERNAME HERE]`

Log in with your CIS username and password.

Click the `Released assignments` tab, ensure that `Course` is  `pyintro` and
choose `Fetch`. The notebooks for the course will be copied into a local
workspace so you can open and edit them.

Choose a notebook to work on from the list in `Downloaded assignments -> PyIntro`

Some read-only data files that are used in the tutorials can be found under `/data/pyintro/`.

In 2017 this course was given to Astronomy PhDs and included more
astronomy-specific material. We will look at some of that in the session on
November 2nd.
